# Water-Quality-Classification-ML-with-K-means-Random-Forest
Utilized unsupervised learning techniques to analyze and classify water samples based on their quality parameters, and assessing compliance with predefined standards.

Employed K-means clustering to extract informative features from the dataset and implemented Random Forest o classify water samples into positive or negative categories based on the selected features.

Evaluated the classification model using appropriate metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, ensuring reliable classification results
